# Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace

### Task-1 Provision the Machine Learning Workspace

1. Create a Machine Learning Studio workspace. Look at the Infrastructure-as-Code template for the workspace so you can begin to automate this process.
2. View the Resource Group to see all resources created.

### Task-2 Create a Notebook to Run Code

1. Create a new Compute Instance to host your notebook. The Virtual Machine will only be used for the notebook, so use the lowest power machine possible to save you money.
2. Create a new Python notebook using the Python AzureML kernel.
3. Print "Hello, world!" in the notebook to verify that it is working.


### Task-3 Stop or delete the Notebook Server

1. Stop the Compute Instance being used to run the Jupyter notebook.
